*Write a program to print out a calendar for a particular month given the day on which the first of the month occurs together

*Your program should take as input an integer representing the day of the week on which the month begins 
*(1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, ... , 7 for Saturday), and an integer which is the number of days in the 
*month (between 28 and 31 inclusive). Your program should print the appropriate calendar for the month. 
*You can assume that all input data will be valid.
